**Keep Bluetooth headphones awake on Windows 10/11**: a small system-tray app that plays quiet audio (or periodic silent pulses) so your headset stays connected and you never miss the first second of a notification, video, or call.

## Download

No Python or install wizard required: grab the portable `.exe` and run it.

| Download | Link |
|----------|------|
| **BTKeepAlive.exe** (recommended) | [**Download latest release**](https://github.com/tothKarolyDavid/bt-keepalive/releases/latest/download/BTKeepAlive.exe) |
| Checksum file | [SHA256SUMS.txt](https://github.com/tothKarolyDavid/bt-keepalive/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS.txt) |
| All versions | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tothKarolyDavid/bt-keepalive/releases) |

### Quick install

1. Download **BTKeepAlive.exe** using the link above.
2. Move it to a permanent folder, for example `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\BTKeepAlive\`.
3. Double-click to run. A tray icon appears: **blue** when playing, **gray** when paused.
4. Right-click the tray icon → **Launch at startup** if you want it every boot.

> **SmartScreen / antivirus:** Unsigned builds may show a Windows SmartScreen prompt. Choose **More info** → **Run anyway**, or build locally (see [Build from source](#build-from-source)).

### Verify download (optional)

```powershell
Get-FileHash "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\BTKeepAlive.exe" -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the hash with `SHA256SUMS.txt` on the [release page](https://github.com/tothKarolyDavid/bt-keepalive/releases/latest).

## Why use this?

Many Bluetooth headphones power down their radio after a short period of silence. When something new plays, the first moment can be clipped while the link reconnects. BT KeepAlive sends a continuous near-inaudible signal, or a periodic quiet pulse, so Windows keeps the audio path active.

Inspired by tools like [SoundKeeper](https://github.com/amd/SoundKeeper), but focused on a simple tray experience with multiple noise presets and a mostly-silent pulse mode.

---

## Features

- **Noise presets**: white, pink, brown, blue, violet
- **Silent noise preset**: continuous, very quiet brown-shaped noise
- **40 Hz binaural beats** with adjustable carrier (100–300 Hz)
- **Volume control**: slider dialog plus tray presets
- **Pulse keepalive**: short quiet pulse on an interval (mostly silent, like SoundKeeper)
- **Launch at startup**: registry entry when running the built `.exe`
- **System tray**: play/pause, pulse mode, sound, volume, binaural carrier, startup toggle, quit

---

## Using the app

Right-click the tray icon to change sound, volume, and mode. Default is **brown noise** at **2%** volume, usually inaudible at normal listening distance.

| Tray action | What it does |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Play / Pause** | Start or stop the keepalive stream (label shows **Pause** while playing) |
| **Pulse keepalive (mostly silent)** | Toggle pulse mode on/off (checked when pulse mode is active) |
| **Pulse interval… (N s)** | Set how often pulses fire; only shown while pulse mode is on |
| **Sound** | Pick a noise preset or **40 Hz binaural** (selecting a preset switches back to continuous mode) |
| **Volume** | **Adjust volume…** opens a slider dialog; below that, radio presets (0.01%–20%) |
| **Binaural carrier** | Carrier frequency for **40 Hz binaural**: 100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 Hz |
| **Launch at startup** | Add/remove from Windows startup; enabled only when running the `.exe` |
| **Quit** | Exit the app |

### Continuous vs pulse mode

- **Continuous (default)**: plays your chosen preset at low volume. Best when a tiny background hum is acceptable.
- **Pulse**: sends a very short, very quiet pulse every ~55 seconds (configurable). Best when you want the tray icon active but almost no audible output.

If Bluetooth still drops in pulse mode, lower the pulse interval from the tray or in `config.json`.

## Config and logs

Settings live in `%APPDATA%\BTKeepAlive\`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.json` | Preset, volume, pulse timing, autoplay, etc. |
| `app.log` | General application log (rotating) |
| `audio-errors.log` | Audio/stream errors (rotating) |

Set `BTKEEPALIVE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for verbose logging.

<details>
<summary><strong>Config reference</strong></summary>

| Key | Default | Tray |
|-----|---------|------|
| `preset` | `brown` | Sound submenu |
| `volume` | `0.02` | Volume / Adjust volume… |
| `carrier_hz` | `200` | Binaural carrier |
| `keepalive_mode` | `continuous` | Pulse keepalive toggle |
| `pulse_interval_sec` | `55` | Pulse interval… (pulse mode) |
| `pulse_duration_sec` | `1` | JSON only |
| `pulse_amplitude` | `0.0001` | JSON only |
| `sample_rate` | `44100` | JSON only |
| `buffer_seconds` | `0.012` | JSON only |
| `autoplay` | `true` | JSON / `--no-autoplay` |
| `launch_at_startup` | `false` | Launch at startup (.exe only) |
| `playing` | `true` | Play / Pause |

</details>

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to try |
|---------|-------------|
| No sound / app exits on start | Check Windows default playback device; see `%APPDATA%\BTKeepAlive\audio-errors.log` |
| “Already running” | Another instance is in the tray; use **Quit** or Task Manager |
| Startup toggle fails | Run as your normal user; check `app.log` |
| Antivirus blocks the `.exe` | One-file PyInstaller builds are sometimes flagged; allowlist the folder or [build locally](#build-from-source) |
| SmartScreen warning | **More info** → **Run anyway** for unsigned builds |

## For developers

**Requirements:** Windows 10/11, Python 3.11+

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/tothKarolyDavid/bt-keepalive.git
cd bt-keepalive
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m btkeepalive
```

> **Note:** “Launch at startup” only works with the built `.exe`, not `python -m btkeepalive`.

### CLI

```powershell
python -m btkeepalive --version
python -m btkeepalive --config-path
python -m btkeepalive --no-autoplay
```

### Build from source

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.\build.ps1
# Output: dist\BTKeepAlive.exe
```

Optional installer (requires [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)):

```powershell
iscc installer\BTKeepAlive.iss
# Output: dist\BTKeepAlive-setup.exe
```

### Tests and lint

```powershell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check .
pytest
```

### Publishing a release

Push a version tag to trigger the GitHub Actions release workflow:

```powershell
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

The workflow builds `BTKeepAlive.exe`, writes `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and attaches both to a GitHub Release.
